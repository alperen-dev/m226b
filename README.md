# Terminal-based Game "Pong" - [Grade: 5](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Academic_grading_in_Switzerland)

ðŸ’¡Note: This app was a school project [M226b](https://www.modulbaukasten.ch/module/226B/4/de-DE?title=Objektorientiert-(mit-Vererbung)-implementieren) from more than a year ago. This is only a reupload from the GitHub Classroom repo so that it also is publicly accessible.

This repository demonstrates a basic terminal-game based off of "[Pong](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pong)".

Thank you for visiting!
